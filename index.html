                                Where does it come from?
                                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                                old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one
                                of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                                the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
                                comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good 
                                and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                                 popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
                                 comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those 
                                interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero 
                                are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
                                 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
